		<p>Quality education is one of FNs sustainable development goals and is very
			important to secure the future and knowledge of children that live in less
			developed countries. The countries on the south of Sahara have the highest
			absence rates in schools. According to UIS and UNESCO are approximately
			60% of children between 12-17 years old out of school - this corresponds
			to almost 100 million children, and 1/3 of the children in the whole world.
			Poverty and the quality of the schools are some of the main reasons why it
			is so common not to go to school. We have come up with a solution,
			which we belive is the most effective way of working towards this goal. </p>

		<h2 class="col-tall-100 col-small-100"> Future plan </h2>
		<p>Our solution to this problem is to have a system that registers
				attendance, you can then mark absence and a reason has to be given.
				Every class marks the absence and sends them to the main office.
				Here the data gets digitized and analyzed. The analysis is then used to
				map how and who will be rewarded for attending the most! It can also be
				used to identify problems in schools by looking at the reasons for
				absence. The reward will go to the schools with the least absence. To
				avoid major differences, the schools will be divided into different
				"levels" in relation to where they stand from before. Previously awarded
				schools will help other struggling schools with visits and motivation.
				The rewards are made based on what the needs are, whether it is water,
				electricity, automation of agriculture etc.</p>

			<p>With such a system, more schools will have the opportunity to build a society
					that is closer to the UN's sustainability goals. The most important thing for
					the future and the development of the countries south of the Sahara is the
					development of the infrastructure, water supply and expansion of electricity.
					Three factors that separate the schools south from Sahara from the rest of the
					world.</p>
